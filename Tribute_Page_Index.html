          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial
          nationalist, and political ethicist, who employed nonviolent
          resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence
          from British Rule, and in turn inspire movements for civil rights and
          freedom across the world.
